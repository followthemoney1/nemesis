Hi, I am a co-founder of LeadIT it company. One of our areas of focus is our own products. We are currently working on a social platform for gamers. We really want to add there the ability to make a deposit through skins. 

We are making a social network for gamers. Where all esports lovers had the opportunity to follow the latest news and moments from the life or career of people who are professionally engaged in this or have a reputation.

In our product, We would like to see opportunities for the user to make a payment or transfer funds to our platform using skins (for example skinpay), but we would also like to allow users to do this in other ways, for example, through cryptocurrency.

Now our site is almost ready, but we are already looking for opportunities to implement API. At this stage, we have already attracted investors for the 2nd round of investments. Can we count on interaction?
